### New module

#### Create new module

To create a new module, run the following command.

```sh
python manage.py startapp <module_name>
```

and add it to the `INTERNAL_APPS` list in `core/settings.py`.

after that, create some more files in your new module: `urls.py`, `serializers.py`. Details of those files are in the
next section.

#### Module structure

When created, the new module should have the following structure:

- `__init__.py` (should be empty)
- `apps.py` - This file contains the config for current module. It does not need to be changed, just leave it as it is.
- `models.py` - This file contains the models for current module. Write your models in this file.
- `serializers.py` - This file contains the serializers for current module.
- `tests.py` - This file contains the tests for current module. (optional)
- `views.py` - This file contains the views for current module.
- `urls.py` - This file contains the urls for current module. You should write the API in `views.py` and include it in
  this file.
